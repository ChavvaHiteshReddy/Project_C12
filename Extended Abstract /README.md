## Extended Project Abstract

In this project, we plan to build a long-range, high-speed 5G Li-Fi model that can function in all types of indoor systems. We also intend to integrate audio and video transmission.

The exponential growth of data consumption in the digital era necessitates innovative technologies that can complement traditional communication systems. Light Fidelity (Li-Fi), an emerging wireless communication technology, leverages visible light for data transmission and offers unprecedented bandwidth and speed. Integrating Li-Fi with 5G networks presents a transformative solution to address challenges such as spectrum congestion, latency, and energy efficiency.

This study explores the potential of Li-Fi to enhance high-speed 5G data transmission, focusing on its ability to support ultrafast connectivity in environments where radiofrequency (RF) technologies face limitations. Key areas of investigation include the modulation techniques used in Li-Fi, the architecture of hybrid Li-Fi and RF systems, and the optimization of light sources such as LEDs for communication purposes.

Simulation and experimental results highlight the advantages of Li-Fi in achieving data rates exceeding 10 Gbps, reduced latency, and enhanced security, making it ideal for applications like autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and industrial automation. Challenges such as line-of-sight requirements, interference from ambient light, and integration with existing 5G infrastructure are also addressed, along with proposed solutions.

The findings underscore the transformative role of Li-Fi in complementing 5G technologies, paving the way for a robust, energy-efficient, and ultra-fast communication ecosystem. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on next-generation wireless networks and their impact on future connectivity paradigms.
