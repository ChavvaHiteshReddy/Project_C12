**Methodology for Li-Fi-Based High-Speed 5G Data Transmission**

The implementation of high-speed 5G data transmission using Li-Fi technology follows a structured methodology that integrates hardware 

components, communication protocols, and system optimization techniques. The primary objective is to utilize Visible Light Communication 

(VLC) for efficient, interference-free, and secure data transmission.

**Key Steps in the Approach:**

**1. Data Generation & Transmission**

A PC acts as the data source, generating the information for transmission.

The Arduino-based transmitter receives the data and processes it.

The processed data is modulated into light signals using a laser transmitter module.

**2. Light-Based Transmission**

The modulated laser beam carries the encoded data through free space to the receiver.

A 555 Timer IC ensures synchronization and stability of signal transmission.

**3. Reception & Decoding**

A photodetector (receiver diode) captures the incoming light signals and converts them into electrical signals.

The converted signals are processed and decoded using a second Arduino board.

**4. Data Display & Output**

The decoded information is displayed on an LCD screen, ensuring the successful transmission of data.

The system confirms the accuracy and integrity of the transmitted data.
